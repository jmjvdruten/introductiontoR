# Welkom to the introduction to programming with R

R is probably the most widely used open-source software environment for data analysis and statistical graphics in academia and business. It has its own programming language which allows not only interaction with but also extension of its system. With over 16.000 extensions the statistical and computational toolkit is huge making the R programming language the lingua franca of data science.
